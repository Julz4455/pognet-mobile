### Need Help?

Contact peers for help as I won't be focusing on this. If its a major issue, submit an issue or contact me at Constanze#0001 on discord. This is just a simple project (in the same way that pognet is a simple project). It was never designed for production use but can be modified to be used in production.

The same goes for PogNet. PogNet is a simple project that was never intended to be used in production but can be modified for production use.

### Final Notices

Final things, this project and pognet are not the most secure. Please, please, please don't use this in production. I will not be held responsible for any security mishaps.
